We encourage students to discuss assignments in this subject with
other students and with the teaching staff to better understand the
concepts.  However, it's also critical for your individual learning to
be sure you devote concentrated independent effort to solving all the
problems.

This page is designed to give you a sense of what kind of interactions
are allowed, and which are not, when working on 6.390 coursework.  The
policies below are in place in order to help with our primary goal for
the exercises and homework, (i.e., that you deepen your understanding
of the course materials by working through them).

<catsoop-section>All Assignments: Sharing of Work</catsoop-section>

Regardless of the assignment, **you should never use results from
other students, nor from the staff** (from this year or from previous
years), in preparing your solutions to online homework problems, labs, exams, or written answers.  You should not take credit
for computer code or graphics that were generated by other students
unless you developed those materials while working with your assigned
lab partner(s).

In addition, **students should never _share_ their solutions (or staff solutions)**
with other students, including through public code repositories such as Github.

<catsoop-section>Exercises and Homework ("Online Tutor Problems")</catsoop-section>

You are expected to give your best effort and work as far as you can on your
own _for every problem_ before asking for help or using other resources.

If you are still stuck on a problem, you may talk about the question with a
staff member or a fellow student, but all exchanges of information should be
general in nature.  See the [sample interactions](#samples) below for examples
of what is considered okay, and what is inappropriate.

After having received help on an exercise and reaching a solution, you should
wait a day or so, and then try to work through the exercise again from scratch
on your own.

<catsoop-section>Labs</catsoop-section>

You can work with one or more partners in the lab sections.  You and your partner(s) can
equally share all results, code, and graphs that you develop as a team.

You should work through the entirety of the lab _as a team_ to produce one
result, and each partner should be prepared to discuss their results with a
staff member during a lab checkoff.  A "divide-and-conquer" approach, where
each partner only works through a portion of the lab, is unacceptable.

Each partner should enter tutor answers on their own account, and by the end
of the lab, each partner should have a copy of any results, code, and graphs
that you developed as a team.


<catsoop-section>Consequences</catsoop-section>

Incidents of plagiarism will result in a grade of zero on the assignment and,
at the discretion of the staff, may be reported to the Committee on Discipline
(COD).  More information about what constitutes plagiarism can be found at
<http://integrity.mit.edu/>.

<catsoop-section>Sample Interactions</catsoop-section>


Scenario: Alyssa and Ben sit down to work on a homework set together...

<python>


okay(r"""
After trying a question on his own, Ben asks Alyssa for help.  Alyssa asks Ben
a leading question that helps him discover a reasonable next step to take when
solving the problem.
""")

okay(r"""
After trying a question on his own, Ben asks Alyssa for help.  Alyssa talks Ben
through some key ideas using a separate but related
example problem.  Ben then tries to apply these ideas to the problem he was stuck on.
""")

notokay(r"""
Alyssa notices that Ben is struggling with a problem, so she gives him her answer
and explains to him how she arrived at it.
""")

notokay(r"""
After trying a question on his own, Ben asks Alyssa for help, and she explains
that it is easy: you just take equation 3.12 from this book, insert equations
2.5 and 3.2, integrate, and you should get the right answer!
""")


notokay(r"""
After trying a question on his own, Ben asks Alyssa for help.  Alyssa describes
in detail the steps she took to solve the problem.
""")

notokay(r"""
Bob has access to a "bible" of 6.390 answers from previous terms, which he
consults when he gets stuck.
""")


okay(r"""
After having made reasonable efforts individually, Alyssa and Ben talk in
general terms about different approaches to doing a problem.  They draw
diagrams on a whiteboard.  When Alyssa discovers a useful Python structure, she
mentions it to Ben.  When Ben makes an observation about op-amps, he shares it
with Alyssa.
""")

notokay(r"""
As Alyssa and Ben type lines of code, they speak the code aloud to the other
person, to make sure they both have the right code.

<p><i>or...</i></p>

As Alyssa and Ben each solve a circuit, they speak aloud the steps they are
taking, to make sure they are both following the right steps.
""")

notokay(r"""
In a tricky part of the homework, Alyssa and Ben look at each other's screens
and compare them so that they can get their code right.
""")


okay(r"""
After they have both solved a problem, Alyssa and Ben talk in detail about the
approaches they took, and the relative merits/drawbacks of each.
""")

notokay(r"""
Alyssa and Ben sit down to work on a homework set together.  They decide to
divide up the problems: Alyssa will work through the even-numbered problems,
and Ben the odd-numbered ones.  When they are done, they will discuss their
work with each-other so that each has a complete solution.

</python>

Scenario: Louis had a very busy week, and he has made almost no
progress on the week's homework.  Ben wants to help.

<python>
okay(r"""
Ben works near Louis and answers his questions when they come up, after Louis
has made a reasonable effort.
""")

#notokay(r"""
#Ben opens his laptop and consults his own code when helping Louis.
#""")

notokay(r"""
Ben has been helping Louis for a while, but he needs to get back to his own work.
He gives his code to Louis, after Louis promises only to look at it when he really has to.
