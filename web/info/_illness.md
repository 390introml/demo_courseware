If you are sick you should not attend recitation, lab, or in-person
office hours -- we will excuse attendance points for illness so you
will not be penalized; contact 
<a href="mailto:6.390-personal@mit.edu"><tt>6.390-personal@mit.edu</tt></a>
for consideration. Also, if you have personal issues impacting your
attendance, or other personal difficulties affecting your progress on
assignments, please see a Dean in @{s3}, and then you and the Dean
should contact 
<a href="mailto:6.390-personal@mit.edu"><tt>6.390-personal@mit.edu</tt></a>
for assistance and handling of the situation. Please do NOT email any
of the course staff directly.
