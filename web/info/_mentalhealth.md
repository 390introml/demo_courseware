MIT is a challenging environment, and 6.390 is a challenging course.  As such,
it is normal to expect some level of stress (and a lot of hard work) during
6.390.  A certain level of stress is healthy and is part of the learning
process (if it were easy, you probably wouldn't be learning much!).  However,
too much stress can be a bad thing, and if you are feeling overwhelmed, we want
to help, so please don't hesitate to reach out.

Additionally, if you or someone you know is struggling with mental health
issues (including significant stress, mood changes, excessive worry,
substance/alcohol abuse, or problems with eating or sleeping), we strongly
encourage you to contact or visit one or more of the following resources, who
may be able to provide additional guidance and support:

* [Student Support Services](https://studentlife.mit.edu/s3)
* [MIT Medical: Student Mental Health and Counseling](https://medical.mit.edu/services/mental-health-counseling)
* [MIT Peer Ears](https://peerears.mit.edu/)
