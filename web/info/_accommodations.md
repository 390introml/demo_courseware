We are committed to the principle of equal access, and we are more
than willing to make arrangements to help accommodate students with
disabilities or related challenges. In general, knowing about the kind
of help you need earlier in the semester means that we'll be better
prepared to provide that help effectively, in coordination
with Disability and Access Services.
If you have a disability and are not planning to use accommodations,
it is still recommended that you meet with DAS staff to familiarize
yourself with their services and resources. If you have been approved
for accommodations by DAS, 6.390 staff are ready to assist with
implementation. Please send these approved requests to
<a href="mailto:6.390-personal@mit.edu"><tt>6.390-personal@mit.edu</tt></a>
to inform us, and we will work to implement these accommodations.
